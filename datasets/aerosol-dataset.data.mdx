  Aerosols and pollution in a major metropolitan area such as Houston, TX, can impact the general public. It is important to examine the changes in values of aerosol quantity. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the amount aerosols within a particular depth of the atmosphere. The measurement comes from inhibition of the solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth.
