  ## Tracking AOD

  Houston, TX is one of the top ten metropolitan areas in the United States. Though Houston is
ethnically and racially diverse (Emerson et al. 2012) , it is also one of the US&#39;s most economically
segregated metropolitan areas (Nicholson 2017) . A recent study conducted by Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF) shows that economic segregation in the Houston metropolitan area leads to
differences in environmental quality with economically disadvantaged populations being subject
to higher levels of air pollution (Environmental Defense Fund 2020) .

  ### Local Scale Changes in AOD across the Houston Metro

  To determine the change in the Aerosol Optical Depth and its patterns in Harris County, TX.
  U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified six common air pollutants that
affect human health. Referred to as criteria pollutants, these are particulate matter, ozone, sulfur
dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. The EPA monitors and tracks these
criteria pollutants, and their measured amounts in the air gauge environmental quality with
respect to air pollution. Of particular concern are fine particulate matter known as PM2.5
(particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) and ozone. Of the two, PM2.5 accounts for
half of the 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. caused by air pollution (Thakrar et al., 2020).

  ### AOD Changes over Large Urban Areas

  Scientists use GOSAT data to determine changes in atmospheric CO2 over large urban areas, which experienced the largest changes in economic activity associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While OCO-2 is optimized for detecting the subtle, regional-scale changes in CO2, GOSAT has advantages for tracking changes in CO2 emissions over large cities.

  GOSAT observations were analyzed to reveal CO2 concentration enhancements, such as fossil fuel emissions that contribute to higher levels of CO2 lower down in atmosphere over cities, relative to the CO2 concentrations at higher altitudes, which are less affected by city emissions. The figure below shows the CO2 concentration enhancements over Beijing, China, derived from GOSAT observations collected in January through April of each year from 2017 to 2020. The results from earlier years illustrate the amount of month-to-month variability in the observed CO2 enhancements that is typical during this season. However, while the CO2 concentration enhancements vary substantially from month-to-month, they are generally much lower in 2020 than in earlier years.

  Further inspection of the Beijing results reveals that all months in 2020 have smaller CO2 enhancements relative to prior years. While this behavior is consistent with reported COVID-19-related reductions in fossil fuel emissions from Beijing, it is important to remember that these results include variations in CO2 concentrations not only from COVID-19 shutdowns, but also from other processes such as photosynthesis and respiration by plants and transport by passing weather systems.

  Similar results were derived for the other cities. Shanghai shows reduced CO2 enhancements from February through April 2020. For New York, CO2 values were higher in January 2020, close to normal for February, and lower in March, as lockdowns were imposed. There is no data for New York in April due to cloud cover. In New Delhi, Mumbai and Dhaka, the story is somewhat more mixed. The CO2 enhancements are smaller or almost the same in February, reflecting the large role of natural processes, such as year-to-year differences in CO2 uptake and release by forests and crops. In March 2020, CO2 enhancements are higher than in earlier years in New Delhi, and lower in Mumbai and Dhaka. The CO2 enhancements decrease across all three cities in April, as lockdowns are implemented. However, these changes are very difficult to attribute to the pandemic because of the large-scale natural CO2 changes seen across India during this season.
