    ## Going through changes
    ## When governments began implementing shutdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists wondered how the atmosphere would respond to the sudden change in human behavior.
    Houston, TX is one of the top ten metropolitan areas in the United States. Though Houston is
ethnically and racially diverse (Emerson et al. 2012) , it is also one of the US&#39;s most economically
segregated metropolitan areas (Nicholson 2017) . A recent study conducted by Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF) shows that economic segregation in the Houston metropolitan area leads to
differences in environmental quality with economically disadvantaged populations being subject
to higher levels of air pollution (Environmental Defense Fund 2020) .
U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified six common air pollutants that
affect human health. Referred to as criteria pollutants, these are particulate matter, ozone, sulfur
dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. The EPA monitors and tracks these
criteria pollutants, and their measured amounts in the air gauge environmental quality with
respect to air pollution. Of particular concern are fine particulate matter known as PM2.5
(particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) and ozone. Of the two, PM2.5 accounts for
half of the 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. caused by air pollution (Thakrar et al., 2020).
Because of its high population density, Houston has large amounts of vehicular traffic that emits
many of the harmful criteria pollutants. A variety of industries, including the oil refineries,
distributed throughout the Houston metropolitan region are also sources of criteria pollutants.
Periodic intrusion of smoke from fires in Mexico, Central America and the surrounding states is
another source of criteria pollutants affecting the Houston metropolitan region. The combined
effect of these pollution sources results in a variegated spatial pattern of air pollution that makes
it difficult to characterize the environmental quality within the metropolitan region. While the air
quality-monitoring network in the Houston area is more extensive compared to other cities, it
may not be not adequate to capture the complex spatial patterns of pollution in this region. A
recent study using pollution sensors mounted on Google Street View cars (Miller et al. 2020)
shows that there are fine-scale features that are beyond the detection capability of the existing
network. While mobile pollution monitoring sensors are able to identify fine-scale patterns, they
are not available for time periods long enough to detect changes over time. Nor do they provide
monitoring over the entire metropolitan region.
In this context, observations from instruments that have been in continuous operation on NASA
satellites over the last two decades provide valuable insights about particulate pollution affecting
Houston. The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has the
capability to detect and quantify the total amount of particulate matter present within the
atmospheric column at a given geographic location. The MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of
Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product provides such
quantification as the AOD is an indicator of total amount of particulate matter present in an
atmospheric column, an area of air stretching from the ground all the way up, over a given
location.

In this discovery, we used the MAIAC AOD product that is available since year 2000 at 1 km
spacing over a given geographical location to examine spatial patterns of particulate pollution
over the metropolitan region of Houston. Note that while AOD is not a direct indication of

particulate pollution at the surface, prior studies show that it can serve as a proxy for the same
(Chudnovsky et al. 2014) . We used the MAIAC AOD to examine spatial patterns of particulate
pollution by computing decadal averages for the years 2000-2009 and 2010-2019.

[Figure 1, can use slider view]
While the spatially averaged AOD shows a statistically significant decreasing trend over the
Houston metropolitan region (Figure 2), the spatial pattern shows local increases.
[Figure 2]
Comparison of decadal average AOD maps for the two decades show spatial patterns of increase
during the second decade that correlates well with urban growth patterns determined using
satellite observations.
[Figure 3, can use slider view]
Urban growth and increase in particulate pollution both occur in the vicinity of the highway
networks.
We also used the Center for Disease Control (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR) social vulnerability index (SVI) to examine if the increase in particulate
pollution disproportionately affects economically disadvantaged populations. We determined
average AOD for census tracts within Houston that fall within different ranges of economic
vulnerability. We used the percentage of population within a census tract below the 150%
poverty level given in SVI data to characterize the levels of economic disadvantage. We found
that the average AOD over census tracts with high levels of poverty (&gt; 15% of the population) to
be substantially diminished compared to tracts with lower levels of poverty (Figure 3).
[Figure 3, emphasize the two &gt; 15% lines]
However, within census tracts with 5-10% of the population below the 150% federal poverty
level, we found AOD to be significantly higher compared to other regions pointing toward
higher pollution levels.
[Figure 3, emphasize the 5-10% line]
While the burden of particulate air pollution over the Houston metropolitan region has been
steadily declining over the last two decades, local increases have occurred in the recent years.
These local increases most affect people in census tracts with 5-10% of the population below the
150% poverty level. These census tracts are also predominantly located in regions of urban
growth and near major highways. These findings are in contrast to our prior discovery that
examined satellite derived land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy to heat stress [link to prior
discovery]. This prior discovery found that LST and potential for heat stress increases
monotonically with the level of poverty. However, for air pollution the relationship appears to be
more complex, with the populations most affected being located in the vicinity of highways.

The findings of this discovery are consistent with recent assessment by the Environmental
Defense Fund based on air pollution sensors mounted on Google Street View cars (Miller et al.
2020) which found substantial spatial variability in air pollution and that emissions from mobile
sources, especially emissions from diesel vehicles, play an important role in polluting residential
neighborhoods. However, note that while satellite derived AOD is often correlated with surface
pollution, the strength of this association varies depending upon the location. Further studies are
needed to confirm how much of surface air pollution is represented in the satellite observed
patterns of column burdens of pollution.

    ## Measuring Air Pollution on the Ground at Airports
    New research during the pandemic is also looking at how COVID-related travel bans are impacting air quality around airports. Current conditions create a unique opportunity to study airport-related pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. While travel bans and strict regulations around air travel have been in place, air traffic has yet to return to previous levels, and many planes remain grounded.

    They are comparing the on-the-ground sensor information from NASA's [Pandora Project](https://pandora.gsfc.nasa.gov/ "Explore the Pandora Project") with satellite information from TROPOMI. So far, they have found that nitrogen dioxide hotspots in Atlanta shifted from the airport, shown here, to the city center from April-June 2020. By September, however, satellites revealed the airport had reemerged as a dominant nitrogen dioxide emission source.

    ## Seeing Rebounds in NO2
  
    After the initial shock of COVID-related shutdowns in the spring, communities worldwide began to reopen and gradually increase mobility. Cars returned to the road, and travel restrictions slowly eased. These resumptions corresponded with relative increases in nitrogen dioxide levels and other air pollutants, as air quality levels began to return to pre-pandemic levels.
    
    This demonstrates how quickly atmospheric nitrogen dioxide responds to reductions in emissions. They will persist as long as emissions persist and decline rapidly if emissions are reduced.
    
    NASA scientists will continue to monitor nitrogen dioxide levels and long-term trends around the world. NASA is expected to launch its [Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO)](http://tempo.si.edu/overview.html "Explore the TEMPO instrument") instrument in 2022, which will provide hourly, high-resolution measurements of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other air pollutants across North America, improving future air quality forecasts.
