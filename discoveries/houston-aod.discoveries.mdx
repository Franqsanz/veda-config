    ## Implications for Aerosol Optical Depth

   Aerosols can have a variety of implications for the general public. In terms of air quality, aerosols can affect the air quality from high concentrations of pollutants that may pose a risk to public health. The highest risk comes from the power plants where the level of emissions are the highest. However, in recent years, pollutions sources have been regulated by the EPA and has found ways to reduce the amount of emissions.

   Using satellite data from the MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments that observe Earth at different times of the day and provide a global view 1-2 days. This satellite provides crucial information such as Aerosol thickness that aides in determing the trend in aerosol patterns to help determine the track for future pollution.
